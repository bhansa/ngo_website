			<img src="images/about.jpg" alt="about orphancare"><br><br>
			<p>The OrphanCare was started in 1998 in a remote region near Punjab.
			The "mission" is now surrounded by many villages and small towns. 
			There are approximately 100 orphan children on the mission, ranging from newborn to young adults.
			Though it is partially self-supporting thanks to a 60 acre farm, 
			relies primarily on help from caring individuals to keep changing the lives of so many orphan children.
			<br>
			The mission is largely run on a communal basis with many of the staff working as volunteers,
			without pay but the mission helps to meet their needs by providing food and supplies.
			There are also workers who do work for a salary, though it is very minimal. 
			The whole "family" consists of about 220 people. The mission loves to have volunteer workers to help out,
			more information can be found the in volunteering sections of our site.

			<h3>Our Mission</h3><hr><br>
			<p>It  endeavors to provide a loving home, spiritual encouragement, as well as education opportunities
			for all the children in residence. All residents have living relatives that are either unwilling or unable
			to provide care for them, which prevents them from being legally adopted. Therefore, most children 
			who come to Tree of Life, regardless of age, will most likely
			continue in residence  until they complete their University degrees. The orphanage thus becomes 
			a permaent home for its residents</p>
