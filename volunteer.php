			There are many ways that you can help us.
			We are blessed every time we receive gifts from our friends, supporters, and partners.
			Below are the most popular giving opportunities: <p><br>

			<h3>Yearly Budget Needs</h3>
			<p>It has a yearly operating budget that accounts for all the major expenses of running the orphanage.
			This budget does not include incoming funds for projects in need of support, it only identifies known
			and reoccurring expenses. Please click on the Yearly Budget link near the top of page to see our financial needs.</p><br>

			<h3>Sponsor A Child</h3>
			<p>By sponsoring a child you will not only change the future of one boy or girl but possibly change a nation.
			We truly believe that one child can make such an impact in Thailand. Please consider partnering with OrphanCare by
			becoming a sponsor today.</p><br>

			<h3>Support A Project</h3>
			<p>We have a few short term and long term projects that OrphanCare would like to accomplish.
			Some projects require materials, time, or labor. Others may require financial contributions 
			and still others may need your thoughts and prayers. Visit the Current Needs page and see how you can help.</p><br>

			<h3>Send A Gift</h3>
			<p>We realize that not everyone can become a volunteer or send financial gifts. 
			In the past many of our friends and partners have sent books, shoes, clothes, stuffed animals,
			toys, school materials, playground equipment, computers, and all sorts of needed and useful items. 
			If you want to know what you can send go to our Current Needs page or <a href="contactus.php">Contact Us</a>
			and we can give you some ideas.</p><br>

			<h3>I Am Ready To Give. Now What?</h3>

			Give portion of the website. Go to Ways To Give NOW.</p><br>
